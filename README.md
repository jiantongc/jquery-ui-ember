jquery-ui-ember
==================
Forked Luke Melia's <a href='https://github.com/lukemelia/jquery-ui-ember'>jquery-ui-ember repo</a>. While trying to use found out that same View cannot have two jquery UI types because of overriding of 'uioptions', 'uitype', 'uievents' variables and values. So to avoid the problem had to create different mixins for draggable, droppable, resizeable as they are the main ones that can be mixed with other jquery UI types.


Quick start

Now same view can have two different jquery UI widgets.
